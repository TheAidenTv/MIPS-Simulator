# MIPS Simulator
The MIPS Simulator is a Java-based program that simulates the behavior of the MIPS instruction set architecture. The program allows users to load binary MIPS code and run the instructions with a text-based user interface.

This simulator was built as a school project for the course CS 3813: Computer Organisation and Architecutre at the University of New Brunswick by students:

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a deeper understanding of the MIPS instruction set architecture and to provide a fun problem to solve. The simulator is designed for educational purposes and can be used to teach students how to program in MIPS.

## Technologies Used
The project is fully built in Java and does not require any additional libraries or dependencies.

## Features
The MIPS Simulator has the following features:

- Full-run mode: run all MIPS instructions in sequence until the end of the program is reached.
- Single-step mode: run a single MIPS instruction at a time.
- Breakpoints: set breakpoints to pause execution at a specific point in the program.
- Register view: view and modify the contents of MIPS registers.
- Memory dump: print out a range of memory locations.

## Installation and Usage
To use the MIPS Simulator, simply download the Java file and run it on your machine.

Once the program is running, you can type the specified UI elements to navigate and execute your given MIPS file.

## Known Issues and Limitations
The MIPS Simulator is a basic simulator and not all instructions and system calls are implemented. Additionally, there may be bugs or issues that have not yet been identified.

## Contributing
Users are welcome to contribute to the MIPS Simulator by proposing code for additional instructions or helping with bug fixes and suggestions. To contribute, please send an email to our UNB email addresses.

## Additional Information
That's all there is to know about the MIPS Simulator. Have fun exploring the MIPS instruction set architecture!
